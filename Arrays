Problem 1
link : https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

Doing this sum in constant space is important
* One of my idea was to make the values present in the row and cloumn of zero to some temp value
later all the temp values must be made to zero

But what can be the value of temp.
Since if a value is equal to temp and there is no zero in it's colums or row then we would unnecessarly make it zero

So we have an idea of making 
if(matrix[i][j]==0)
    matrix[0][j]=0
    matrix[i][0]=0
    
they would have the same meaning right but check for the new position place if it is non zero then we are including extra case.
